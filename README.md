# Numerical Methods
This repository contains implementations of various numerical methods commonly using Fortran 95 programming language and Wolfram Mathematica for symbolic computation and representations. The following topics are covered:

## Nonlinear Equations
Numerical techniques for solving nonlinear equations using iterative methods like Newton-Raphson, bisection, and the secant method.

## Interpolation and Function Approximation
Methods for interpolating data points and approximating functions using polynomial interpolation as lagrange interpolation and spline interpolation.

## Numerical Differentiation and Integration
This section covers algorithms for computing derivatives and integrals numerically. It includes finite difference methods and quadrature rules for differentiation and integration, respectively. Methods such as Richardson 
extrapolation and various symmetric and non-symmetric formulas are used for derivative approximation. For integration, methods like Simpson's rule, Newton-Cotes methods (including the trapezoidal rule), and Gauss-Legendre quadrature are employed.

## Solution of Differential Equations
Numerical techniques for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, encompassing explicit and implicit methods for time integration, finite difference methods for spatial discretization, and additional methods such as the Taylor method,
Heun's method, Modified Euler's method (Midpoint method), and the Runge-Kutta 4th order method. 

## Linear Systems of Equations
Algorithms for solving systems of linear equations, including direct and iterative methods. 
For Linear Systems of Equations, we use:
- Triangular Systems of Equations: Suitable for triangular coefficient matrices.
- LU Decomposition: Applied for non-triangular coefficient matrices.
